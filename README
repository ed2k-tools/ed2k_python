ed2k_metutils.py
================

	A python framework for easy manipulation of .part.met files ( edonkey and overnet download meta-information ).

	This set of classes allows for rapid development of ed2k tools, using a very simple API.

Usage:
======

	There are ( at the time of writing ) three simple example progams included with the main class file.  You can use these as templates for your own work without attribution.  The basic pattern when writing a script with this library is:

	* Import it.  ( I usually dirty the name space because of the long class prefixes otherwise. )
	* Construct a MetFile class instance using a byte-stream read from disk or another source.
	  [ You can also construct an empty met-file, and then populate it. ]
	* Read and write "Tags" from the file ( explained later ).
	* Call ReduceToData on the instance, and write the resulting byte stream to disk.
	* ???
	* Profit!

	The data structure is actually pretty straight forward.  It's just that the implementation can be a bit fiddly - hence this library.  This kind of structure ( lists of hashes, some attributes, lists of tags ) is easy to work with an implement in python, because of the excellent list code.

Explanation of the Data Structure:
==================================

	The MetFile class has three attributes and two internal lists.  The attributes are: a version number ( usually 224, at least prior to Overnet 0.46 ), a modification date ( pretty much unused at the moment ) and an overall file hash ( this is what you see in an ed2k:// link - it's a sixteen byte array ).

	These are represented with public member variables .version, .modDate and .fileID respectively.

	The first list contains a set of partial hashes, derived, I believe, from other users on the network.  There should be one of these for each 9728000 bytes.  As these really shouldn't be played with too much ( unless you are trying to MD4 verify individual 9mb blocks within a file ), they don't have helper methods - just tweak the .p_hashes member array.

	The second list is the meta tags.  These get their own section.

Meta Tags:
==========

	The .part.met file uses a flexible and extensible system of meta-tags to store various pieces of information in the file ( such as how much of it has been downloaded so far ).  The general rule is that a meta-tag consists of a type, a title, and a value.  Tag titles with a length of one are generally an unprintable character and represent a special tag:

	0x01 = Filename.         ( TAG_HANDLE_FILENAME )
	0x02 = Filesize.         ( TAG_HANDLE_FILESIZE )
	0x03 = Filetype.         ( TAG_HANDLE_FILETYPE )
	0x04 = File Format.      ( TAG_HANDLE_FILEFORMAT )
	0x08 = Bytes downloaded. ( TAG_HANDLE_SOFAR )
	0x18 = Temp file name.   ( TAG_HANDLE_TEMP_NAME )
	0x19 = Priority.	 ( TAG_HANDLE_PRIORITY )
	0x20 = Paused.		 ( TAG_HANDLE_PAUSED )

	Fig 1 - a sadly incomplete list of meta tag special tag handles.

	This list gives the byte representation, english name, and a defined variable inside the library you can use to refer to it ( see the examples ).  As usual, there are exceptions.

	0x09 = File gap begins.  ( TAG_HANDLE_GAP_START )
	0x10 = File gap ends.    ( TAG_HANDLE_GAP_END )

	Fig 2 - rulebreaking dissident tags, bringers of heart-break.

	These are special tags, but have tag title lengths != 1.  The form here is the special tag character, followed by an ascii representation of a number.  These numbers group tag beginnings and endings into matching pairs ( see the fix_sofar example to see this in action ).

	We add tags to MetFile instances by instantiating a MetaTag class with appropriate arguments.  You can't create blank MetaTags - they take instantiation arguments of a tag title, a tag value, and optionally a tag type, which should be TAG_TYPE_STRING or TAG_TYPE_INTEGER ( the only supported types in the specification - store floats as strings ) - very crappy type autodetection will be attempted if nothing is specified.

	MetaTag data can be accessed via member variables .name and .value.

	To obtain a list of, or remove, given tags from a MetFile instance, use the FindTags or PurgeTags member functions.  They take an argument of the tag title in question.  Astute readers will have noticed this will be a problem with tags 0x09 and 0x10, as you need to know the number of the gap to be able to pinpoint its paired relevant tags.  A shortcut, if you wish to specify ALL tags in this class, has been provided - pass a second argument of '1' to the above two functions.

	When this 1 is passed, and the tag title specified is one character long, it will attempt to match the candidate keys on their first character.  This works well.  ( Again, see the sofar example for more detail ).

	I think I've covered everything that needs to be dealt with here.  There are a few other little helper functions, notably getMD4, getEd2K, etc, but they are reasonably self-explanatory, and everything has a ( crappy ) doc-string.  Drop me a line if you need more information.

Testing Environment:
====================

	MacOSX 10.2.4 + Python 2.2 + Overnet 0.42 -> 0.46.1
	Prepared in VIM.
